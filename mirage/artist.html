<h2> Hash I Shows I </h2>
	<p id="pk">Based in Brussels, Krisy first started to make music in 2010 “with a bunch of friends just for fun and for the love of art”. Since then, he’s produced a number of Gold-certified records in France as De La Fuentes (his side project as a producer and sound engineer) for Damso as well as released fiery but equally smooth tracks of his own as Krisy.</p>
	<h3>"Sa Gogo Danseuse"</h3>
	<p id="pk2">As part of the latest installment of our COLORS shows, Krisy performs a brand new track called “Julio & Sa Gogo Danseuse”, serving as a sneak peek into his forthcoming project Paradis D’amour (which translates to Love Paradise). Set to be released this Valentine’s Day, the project will be an exploration of love and relationships soundtracked by Krisy’s slick production and heartfelt songwriting.</p>

	<h2> Hash I Shows I </h2>
	<p id="pjr">Toronto based singer/songwriter Jessie Reyez has been creating waves for quite some time now, and rightly so – as her sumptuous R&B gems are absolutely stunning. Somewhere in between SZA’s poignant and poetic artistry and Bibi Bourelly’s uncompromising and honest songwriting, whilst bringing her own unique personality to the table, Jessie Reyez is without a doubt one of the most exciting artists around.</p>
	<h3>"Figures"</h3>
	<p id="pjr2">Accompanied by nothing but the gentle strums of her guitar, Jessie Reyez performs an absolutely breathtaking version of her breakthrough single “Figures” which is lifted from her Kiddo EP which dropped earlier this year. </p>
	<p id="pjr3">With each and every note, Reyez has you leaning in closer as her haunting and effortlessly graceful, whispered vocal renders you spellbound. You can’t help but be captivated by her performance – so much so- that you feel as if she’s singing the song to you alone.
Pure magic.</p>

	<h2> Hash I Shows I </h2>
	<p id="pt">Fresher than ever, Montclair based artist provides a punchy and utterly groovy rendition of the sizzling banger that is "Tropicana" - lifted from his equally impressive Arcade project. </p>

	<h2> Hash I Shows I </h2>
	<p id="plk">“Joy” is the latest single from prolific Santa Monica artist Leven Kali, who continues to expand his stylistic boundaries while delivering a message of hope.</p>
	<h3>"Joy"</h3>
	<p id="plk2">“Joy” considers the pure despair and the resourceful hope one can feel when confronted by today’s social, economic and political adversities. Throughout Kali sings about racism, immigration, civil rights with powerful lines like “It break my heart every time I turn the news on and see the police shot another young brother.” The track also centers around the theme of self-empowerment, as seen through his backstory of being a determined 18-year-old in the studio. The two messages converge on a repeated line, “Now you might feel it take too long, but we gon’ fight and keep on marching to our dream.”</p>
